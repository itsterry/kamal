# Servers
#
# Servers are split into different roles, with each role having its own configuration.
#
# For simpler deployments, though, where all servers are identical, you can just specify a list of servers.
# They will be implicitly assigned to the `web` role.
servers:
  - 172.0.0.1
  - 172.0.0.2
  - 172.0.0.3

# Custom SSH ports
#
# Each server can specify a custom SSH port using the format `hostname:port`.
# This is useful when servers on the same IP are accessible via different ports.
# The per-host port overrides the global `ssh.port` setting for that specific server.
servers:
  - 172.0.0.1
  - 172.0.0.2:2222
  - 172.0.0.3:2223

# Tagging servers
#
# Servers can be tagged, with the tags used to add custom env variables (see kamal docs env).
servers:
  - 172.0.0.1
  - 172.0.0.2: experiments
  - 172.0.0.3: [ experiments, three ]

# Roles
#
# For more complex deployments (e.g., if you are running job hosts), you can specify roles and configure each separately (see kamal docs role):
servers:
  web:
    ...
  workers:
    ...
